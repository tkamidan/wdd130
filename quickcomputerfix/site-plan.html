      <h3>Services</h3>
      <p>Timing</p>
      <p>We are very fast with getting the job done! If we do not finish the project in the amount of time that we told you in the beginning after the first diagnosis we will give you a certain portion of your money back guaranteed. </p> <p>Pricing</p>
      <p>Each in-person checkup will be a fee of 40 dollars and each virtual checkup will be a fee of 20 dollars. Depending on the repair job, the cost could vary depending on the labor requirements for the employee and depending on the price of the parts that are needed in the repair job. We try to check your computer fast so you can get on with your day. If the checkup takes longer than expected then we will give you a 5% discount on the checkup price.</p>
      <p>Unsatisfactory</p>
      <p>We do realize that we have many employees around the world, and you may not be as satisfied with some of the work that some of our employees do so we will give you a full refund if that is the case. We also believe that we are responsible for any additional damage done to your device in the repair process, so if we make the device unusable we will replace the device in addition to a free refund.</p>

        We are hiring all the time! At Quick Computer Fix, we are looking for qualified Computer Technicians that have a lot of experience. Technicians at Quick Computer Fix need to have experience fixing computers already. We test all of our employees before we hire them by shipping them a range of products to fix and if they successfully send back and fix the products they pass the test. You do, however, have to pay a certain amount of money to do the test and if you send the products back, you will get a free refund on that price. If you do not have enough money to pay for these products, we will make some accommodations. If you have a major in Computer hardware technology, Computer repair technology, PC maintenance, Information technology, Information science, Computer science, Computing and security, and Engineering, you do not have to take the test. You can also apply for your Computer Technician business as a whole to become a Certified Quick Computer Fix Business. You will get a large portion of the money for each transaction you do with customers. If you lie about any of the things said above or do a bad job of fixing a computer then you may be fired. We need YOU to continue to grow our company to make fixing Computers easy!
