        <p>We are hiring all the time! At Quick Computer Fix, we are looking for qualified Computer Technicians that have a lot of experience. Technicians at Quick Computer Fix need to have experience fixing computers already. We test all of our employees before we hire them by shipping them a range of products to fix and if they successfully send back and fix the products they pass the test. You do, however, have to pay a certain amount of money to do the test and if you send the products back, you will get a free refund on that price. If you do not have enough money to pay for these products, we will make some accommodations. If you have a major in Computer hardware technology, Computer repair technology, PC maintenance, Information technology, Information science, Computer science, Computing and security, and Engineering, you do not have to take the test. You can also apply for your Computer Technician business as a whole to become a Certified Quick Computer Fix Business. You will get a large portion of the money for each transaction you do with customers. If you lie about any of the things said above or do a bad job of fixing a computer then you may be fired. We need YOU to continue to grow our company to make fixing Computers easy!</p>
