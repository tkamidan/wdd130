                <h4>Timing</h4>
                <p>We are very fast with getting the job done! If we do not finish the project in the amount of time that we told you in the beginning after the first diagnosis we will give you a certain portion of your money back guaranteed.</p>

                <h4>Pricing</h4>
                <p>Each in-person checkup will be a fee of 40 dollars and each virtual checkup will be a fee of 20 dollars. Depending on the repair job, the cost could vary depending on the labor requirements for the employee and depending on the price of the parts that are needed in the repair job. We try to check your computer fast so you can get on with your day. If the checkup takes longer than expected then we will give you a 5% discount on the checkup price.</p>

                <h4>Satisfactory</h4>
                <p>We do realize that we have many employees around the world, and you may not be as satisfied with some of the work that some of our employees do so we will give you a full refund if that is the case. We also believe that we are responsible for any additional damage done to your device in the repair process, so if we make the device unusable we will replace the device in addition to a free refund.</p>
